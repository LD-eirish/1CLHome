## WHO WE ARE

1CL is a regiment organised as a federation of specialist sub‑regiments. We operate as a unified Legion while preserving the identity and autonomy of each member sub‑regiment. In addition to our Central Group regiments, we maintain an Associate wing that coordinates independent regiments for operational collaboration.

Our focus is on expanding, training and recruiting our sub‑regiments that can plug directly into 1CL’s command structure. We emphasize practical training across combat, naval and logistics..

## WHAT WE OFFER

- Being part of a union of regiments, each with their individual play-style.
- Role tracks: A simple progression system.  
- Cross‑regiment coordination with the Associate wing for larger operations and events.  
- A culture that balances creativity with great teamwork.

## WHO WE'RE LOOKING FOR

- Players with any kind of play-style! 1CL and their sub-regiments have it all!
- Specialists in logistics, base management, and fleet operations.  
- Aspiring officers.  

- **Regiments Commanders that are interested in the 1CL concept!**


## NOTE ON STRUCTURE

1CL functions as a federation: Central Group sub‑regiments are the core of our regimented operational capability, while the Associate Group hosts partner regiments that collaborate on operations and joint efforts. Members keep their sub‑regiment identity while benefiting from Legion‑level coordination and support.
